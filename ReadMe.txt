The code reads the dataset using Pandas, drops the 'species' column (as clustering and PCA are unsupervised), and converts it to a NumPy array for further processing.

The K-Means Clustering algorithm is applied to the dataset, and the resulting clusters and centroids are visualized using matplotlib.

Similarly, the Principal Component Analysis algorithm is performed on the dataset, and the transformed data is plotted in a scatter plot, showing the first two principal components.
